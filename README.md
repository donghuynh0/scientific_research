## **Model Selection**

We use the following regression models for training and evaluation:  

- **Decision Tree Regressor**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  

### **Target Variables**  
The models are trained and evaluated on three different target variables:  

1. **D**  
2. **D * ρ**  
3. **D * ρ / √T**
